        <p>Note: This page will be updated with game graphics and more detailed rules soon.</p>
        <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Rules</span></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each deck consists of 40 cards, with a maximum of 4 copies of the same card in a deck. Only 1 copy of a Challenger rarity card can be in a deck.</li>
            <li>Players start the game by drawing their hand. Player 1 will go first and draw 4 cards, and Player 2 will go second and draw 5 cards.</li>
            <li>A hand cannot contain more than 7 cards. A card will not be drawn if a player has the maximum hand size.</li>
            <li>If a player runs out of cards in their deck and is forced to draw, they lose.</li>
            <li>Players have a gold total and a gold income. Every turn, the gold income amount is added to the gold total, which stacks so the gold total doesn’t reset at the end of the turn. Gold income can only be increased using card effects.</li>
            <li>Spell cards are always played face down, and then can be activated at any time. A player can choose to play a spell and not activate it for a few turns, or can activate it immediately.</li>
            <li>Each player gets 3 towers and a nexus. The Tier 1 tower will do 1 true damage back to attackers, the Tier 2 tower will do 2 true damage back to attackers, and the Tier 3 tower will do 3 true damage back to attackers. Killing the enemy nexus wins the game.</li>
            <li>Only one tower can be destroyed a turn. Overlapping damage does not go to the next tower.</li>
            <li>Players declare attacks, but not what they will be attacking. The defending player gets the advantage of choosing which creatures to block with, and what damage to take to their face.</li>
            <li>Each player draws a card at the beginning of their turn. They can pay 5 gold to draw an additional card.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Card Rules</span></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Magic resist cancels out magic&nbsp;damage, and armor cancels out physical damage. Two magic resist will block two magic&nbsp;damage, and vice versa.</li>
            <li>There are four types of damage — Physical,&nbsp;Magic, Mixed, and True. Physical is a red sword, Magic is a blue sword, Mixed is a purple sword, and True is a black sword.</li>
            <li>Mixed damage will deal damage based off the enemy card’s lowest stat.</li>
            <li>True damage ignores resistances and deals base damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Influence Points</span></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Influence points are the main currency used to purchase card packs. There is no way to purchase influence points with real money, as this is not a pay to win game.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to earn influence points. You can earn influence points by opening them in a hextech crate.&nbsp;You can also earn influence points by playing League of Legends matches and connecting your League of Cards account with your League of Legends account. Sometimes, you will randomly be rewarded influence points for destroying a card in a ranked match.</li>
            <li>To connect your League of Legends account, you just need to submit your summoner name. You will be asked to change a mastery page to a certain keyword to verify that you own the account. We will <strong>NEVER&nbsp;</strong>ask for your account password or personal information.</li>
            <li>Players have a chance to earn a hextech crate after every game. A hextech crate can contain many various rewards for your account, with the main reward being influence points. You will also be able to unlock icons, music tracks, card packs, individual cards, and much more.</li>
            <li>Influence points can be spent on card packs. Various sets will cost different amounts. They can also be used to purchase specific cards from other players in the trading room.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trading</span></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Players can post a specific card they are looking to trade for, and other users can search through that player’s collection and make a trade offer.</li>
            <li>Influence points can be offered up instead of cards, and the player posting the trade can set up an offer to pay the other player a certain amount of influence points for the card.</li>
            <li>All trades are final and cannot be undone. Be sure that you agree to the deal before accepting, as misclicks&nbsp;will not be undone.</li>
            <li>Cards from the base deck cannot be traded.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ranked Play</span></h2>
        <p>The ranked system is set up similarly to the League of Legends ranked system. There will be different tiers — bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master, and challenger. The higher a player’s rank, the better the chance that they will have of gaining a hextech crate from a victory. The Challenger tier will be posted.</p>
        <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tournaments</span></h2>
        <p>We are considering doing prize tournaments, which will be based off user input and the amount of players participating. These will be weekend tournaments that go from Friday – Sunday. One type of prize tournament will allow players to contribute to a “prize pool” for a set price, for a chance to win the real money pot. The other type of tournament may be special prizes we do from time to time such as free League of Legends RP cards, gaming gear, and sponsorship prizes.</p>
